This project is the companion to [React-Rails-starter](https://github.com/English3000/React-Rails-starter).

It is a `create-react-native-app`. I've developed it using Expo's [XDE](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html), including its [`SecureStore`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/securestore.html) for persisting the current user.

Basic for mobile. You can copy & paste your web app's frontend into your own project using **React-Rails-starter** [custom components](https://github.com/English3000/React-Rails-starter/blob/react-rails-starter/frontend/utils/elements.js).
